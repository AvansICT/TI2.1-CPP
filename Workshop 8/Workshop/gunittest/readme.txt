Windows build steps for gunittest

The GoogleTest can be generated with visual studio for this project this was 
NOT done. The GoogleTest sources were downloaded and unzipped manually.
And these were included in the visual studio project. Look at the gtest filter
in the gunittest project for the included GoogleTest source files. And gtest-all.cc
was excluded from build.

1. Download the GoogleTest - Google Testing and Mocking Framework
from https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/v1.17.0.zip

2. Unzip GoogleTest to the folder Workshop 8
The structure should be like this:
Workshop 8
  |-- Workshop
	   |-- gunittest
			|-- CMakeLists.txt
			|-- gunittest.cpp
  |-- googletest-1.17.0

3. Check if the archive is unzipped correctly
Check if the file /googletest-1.17.0/googletest/include/gtest/gtest.h exists
(the include directories are hardcoded in visual studio project file
 project properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories)

4. build project with visual studio

Linux build steps for gunittest

1. Open terminal

2. Install gcc and g++ compilers
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install g++

3. Install cmake and make
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install make

4. Install unzip
sudo apt install unzip

5. Download the zip file from github
wget https://github.com/AvansICT/TI2.1-CPP/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

6. Unzip the file
unzip main.zip

7. Download the GoogleTest - Google Testing and Mocking Framework
wget https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/v1.17.0.zip
8. Unzip the GoogleTest to the folder Workshop 8
unzip v1.17.0.zip -d TI2.1-CPP-main/Workshop\ 8/

10. Check if the archive is unzipped correctly
Check if the file googletest-1.17.0/googletest/include/gtest/gtest.h exists
(the include directories are hardcoded in CMakeLists.txt)

11. navigate to the unzipped folder
cd TI2.1-CPP-main/Workshop\ 8/Workshop/gunittest/

12. Create a build folder and navigate to it
mkdir build
cd build

13. Make sure g++ is used as C++ compiler
   (note: for c files use the gcc compiler must be used)
export CXX=/usr/bin/g++

14. Run cmake
cmake ..

15. Run make
make

16. Run the program
./gunittest
